<h1>About the middleware</h1>

Marf-PHP uses <code>middleware</code> in it's <code>urls.php</code> file. Middleware is used to add additional checks before a view is visited. The <code>Middleware</code> class is accessable throughout the whole framework. Every file in the middleware folder, containing <code>.mw.php</code>, is seen as a middleware file and thus automatically registered by the framework. Each middleware class needs to extend off of the <code>Middleware</code> class, and needs to overwrite the <code>private static $name</code> attribute and the <code>public function check($arg = null)</code> method. The method has a optional <code>$arg</code> var that can store any var. You can pass it through to the middleware from the <code>urls.php</code> file. The check method is required to return a bool. In the method, you create your own logic.
