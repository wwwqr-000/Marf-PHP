<h1>About the public folder</h1>

The <code>public/</code> folder contains two important files. These files are the most important files of the whole framework. the <code>.htaccess</code> file contains rules for pointing to the other important file, <code>index.php</code>. If the framework doesn't work, there is a big chance the <code>.htaccess</code> file is not accepted by your webserver. You can fix this by updating your webserver config for the website. <code>index.php</code> contains all the setup logic of a single request. All requests made start at <code>index.php</code>. The <code>public/</code> folder should contain your public assets, such as <code>js, css and image</code> assets. Think of the <code>public/</code> folder as a place where every user can come. If you want to store private files (For example a application users can download, but they should pay for it first), then the best thing you could do is create a new folder in the same folder the <code>urls.php/</code> file is located in.
