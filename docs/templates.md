<h1>About the templates of Marf-PHP</h1>


Marf-PHP uses the word "templates" to group base-class files. These files contain the base classes of the framework. Use inheritance ("extends") to extend your own class based on a base-class. Classes like <code>Middleware</code> and <code>View</code> are default classes in Marf-PHP. You should not remove or change them if you don't know what you are doing. Classes like <code>Security</code> or <code>Database</code> are not listed in here, because they should not be extended by a custom class.
